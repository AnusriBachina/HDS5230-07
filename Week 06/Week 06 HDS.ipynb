This method reduces the average distance people must travel, making it easier for them to access mental health services.\n",
        "\n",
        "Assumptions in Computing Fitness:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Equal Demand for Mental Health Services: Every individual in the dataset has an equal likelihood of needing mental health services.\n",
        "2. Distance is the Primary Accessibility Factor: Shorter distances directly translate to better access, ignoring other factors such as availability of transportation, socioeconomic barriers, or facility capacity.\n",
        "3. No Variations in Facility Capabilities: All FQHCs have equal capacity to handle mental health patients, meaning they can all offer the same level of service.\n",
        "4. Population Sampling is Representative: Considering a 0.01% sample of the population data for efficiency, the small sample accurately represents the entire population’s distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "By focusing on minimizing average distance, this method ensures that more people can access mental health services with the least amount of travel time.\n",

        "\n",
        "Optimization Objective: To minimize travel distance, the goal is to select FQHCs with the lowest average distance to residences. The lower the fitness score, the better the FQHC site for mental health service placement. By minimizing the average distance, this approach ensures that the selected FQHCs are located as close as possible to the majority of the population, increasing accessibility and utilization of mental health services."
